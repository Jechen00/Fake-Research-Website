                    <h2 class="subtitle">Mini Biography</h2>
                    <h3 class="text">I was born in 1977 in the blazing hot, shark-infested city of Venice, Florida. I lived and studied in my hometown for over 20 years, up until I graduated from Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College in 1997 and began travelling the world as part of the Carson & Barsons Circus â€” the World's Biggest Big Top Show (according to them at least). I happily worked as a clown and lion-tamer for 15 years before being forced to retire due to an incident involving a lion, 2 small children, 4 cans of hair spray, a missing shoe, and a toaster (I swear I was not the one at fault).</h3>

                    <h3 class="text">For the next 6 years, I continued to play a role in the circus community through studying and examining what professional researchers call "clown science," contributing to the fruition of a number of research papers, specifically involving the anatomy and psychology of a clown. Through this line of work, I fell in love with research and science, leading me to currently try to pursue two bachelor degrees in Astrophysics and Mathematics at UC Berkeley.</h3>

                    <h2 class="subtitle">The Anatomy of the Shrinking Clown</h2>
                    <h2 class="text">A few years being relieved of my clown duties, I was given the opportunity to join a research group focused on understanding the complex anatomical structure of a clown in 2013. Specifically, the research group was interested in learning about the components that contribute to a clowns trademark ability of being able to fit into a small car already occupied by 30 plus people. With dissections and post-mortem examinations on clowns apparently being ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (thankfully), the research group resorted to a set of oral testimonies and "peaceful" trials, in which they were able to observe how different body parts contorted and interacted with one another to allow the clown to effectively shrink in size. As an ex-clown, my role was primarily centered on vitial community outreach and guiding the research group through the ironically unfunny history of clown culture, as we used this traditional knowledge, in conjunction with the data, to draw a coherent conclusion.</h2>

                    <h2 class="subtitle">Psychology of a Clown</h2>
                    <h1 class="text">In 2018, I was once again approached by another research group and was asked to partake in their analysis of the various psychological factors that may be at play when it comes to the frequent emergence of horrifically grotesque and barbarous, human-eating clowns. My role consisted of interpreting the messages/motives within the recorded interview responses given by convicted clowns and identifying consistent patterns of thought that may correlate with the aforementioned psychological factors. Furthermore, while my particular research group primarily focused on cases in the United States, including the well-documented Pennywise incident in Maine, a secondary group conducted an investigation on the supposedly necrotic clown, Richard "Stitches" Grindle, in Dublin, Ireland. From this, I also contributed in comparatively analyzing the information recieved from the research in these two different countries in an attempt to discern whether or not these murderous clown outbreaks may have underlying causes that span on a global scale (I have no idea what I am writing at this point).</h1>
